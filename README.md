Special-purpose software for Warwick Statistics internal reports on module marks

This is open source software, but unlikely to be of interest to anyone not involved 
in the administration of the Department of Statistics at the University of Warwick.

## Instructions

**norman** is an _R_ package, and there is a short document (a _vignette_ in _R_) that gives instructions on how to 
install it and use it.  The vignette can either be viewed in _R_ (once the package
has been installed!), or directly on the web at 
https://davidfirth.github.io/norman/Instructions.html

## Why "norman"?

Because I needed a memorable name for this package.  And because _nobody_ was ever 
better at marking:
